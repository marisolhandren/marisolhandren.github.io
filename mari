	<center><p>I am motivated and hardworking and over my years spent at the University of Maine those qualities have flourished even more throughout all the work
	I've put into my classes and activities I'm involved in on campus. I love studying marketing even though that's not what I originally chose as my path entering college
	but now I'm happy I'm in this major. I gained valuable experience so far from a variety of classes such as fiancial accounting, marketing reseach, and the legal environment of business.
	I've also joined the marketing club, volleyball club, and best buddies club since I've been a student at the Univeristy of Maine.</p></center>
